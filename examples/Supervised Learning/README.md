## Supervised Learning

This folder contains simple, from-scratch implementations of **supervised learning algorithms**. These models learn from **labeled data**, meaning each input has a known correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to targets that generalizes well to unseen data.

Supervised learning is commonly used for **classification** and **regression** tasks.

### Common Use Cases
- Predicting categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam)
- Predicting numerical values (e.g., house prices, sales forecasting)
- Credit risk assessment and fraud detection

### Algorithms Included
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Perceptron
- Decision Tree
- Ensemble Models

### Typical Workflow
1. Split data into training and testing sets  
2. Train the model using labeled data  
3. Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy or MSE  
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data

Each implementation is intentionally lightweight and educational, focusing on core algorithmic ideas rather than performance optimizations.
