## Algorithms Included in MLPackage

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression** — Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with RMSE and R² evaluation.
- **Logistic Regression** — Batch gradient descent with sigmoid activation, probability outputs, and accuracy metrics.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** — Classic distance-based classifier supporting multiple distance metrics.
- **Decision Trees** — Recursive tree-building using information gain and entropy (classification) or variance reduction (regression).
- **Perceptron** — Single-layer neural network for binary classification.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** — Feedforward neural network with backpropagation, softmax output, and cross-entropy loss.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering** — Centroid-based clustering with inertia computation.
- **DBSCAN** — Density-based clustering for arbitrary-shaped clusters.
- **PCA** — Dimensionality reduction and variance analysis.
- **SVD** — Singular value decomposition for feature extraction and latent representation.
